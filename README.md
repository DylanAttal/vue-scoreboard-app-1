# Vue Scoreboard App

<img src="public/assets/vue-scoreboard.gif">

This is a small app meant to demonstrate some of the basics of Vue. I made this app for the Vue.js Tampa Bay meetup held on Tuesday, November 26th entitled Build an App From the Ground Up.

This app keeps score of a generic sports game. The user can add or subtract points from team scores, update team names, and create new teams. Once a team has over seven points, that team wins and the user can reset the game.

## Technical goals

Utilizing the Vue CLI, participants of the meetup and I built this app together live. Some of the goals were:

- [x] build a new component
- [x] pass down props from parent component to child component
- [x] iterate over an array in the `template` using the `v-for` attribute
- [x] use `v-model` to enable two-way data binding on form elements
- [x] use computed properties to update data when their reactive dependencies are changed
- [x] import a third-party library, Bootstrap, and use its components
